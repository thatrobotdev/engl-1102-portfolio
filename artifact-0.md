# Artifact 0 – Common First Week Video

{% comment %}
    A page for your multimodal diagnostic video, which you produced during the first week of class, along with a reflection answering the directed reflection questions about the artifact.

## Introduction

{% comment %}
    Write a one-paragraph introduction (150-200 words) to the artifact that articulates your intellectual process in composing this artifact. Put another way, explain where your ideas came from and the ways they evolved during the course of the project. You should also discuss ways the composing processes (examples: prewriting, outlining, drafting, peer reviewing, revising, editing) affected your intellectual process, and vice versa.

Artifact 0 was my first chance in ENGL 1102 to introduce myself, and be vulnerable with a challenge I would anticipate facing in the coming semester. While I was tasked with articulating a challenge relating to one of the modes–written, oral, visual, electronic, or nonverbal–that I would be engaging with in class projects this semester, I wanted to approach the challenge with the perspective of goal-setting and positivity to start the semester off on the right foot. So, I looked for ways to inject humor with my planning for the project. I first had the idea of adapting a Hamilton song but quickly realized that making a 90-second parody that got across all of my ideas would take more time than I had to complete the project. So, I pivoted to a plot-based introduction like a video that I really enjoyed based on a James Bond movie and decided to integrate references to the popular video game Among Us. After deciding on Among Us it felt very easy to generate the plot of the video.

## Reflection

### Goals

{% comment %}
    What were the main intellectual goals of the assignment? Please situate these goals in terms of the course theme and in terms of the communication strategies you were to learn or practice.
{% endcomment %}

For this artifact, the main intellectual goal was to critically examine my own skills as a writer and communicator. As the course theme is Multimodal *Moby-Dick; or, the Whale* of WOVEN Communication, this class will heavily focus on the five modes of communication (Written, Oral, Visual, Electronic, and Nonverbal Communication). By laying out the challenges that I expect to face in relation to the written communication mode, I am planning my first year as a writer in the Georgia Tech community to prepare to write on a college level. I am also preparing to engage with the WOVEN paradigm through future assignments that I complete in this class by recognizing and applying my research into the different modes of communication for this project.

## Argument/Purpose

{% comment %}
    What is your argument or purpose? How did you make the argument or purpose visible and persuasive in your artifact?
{% endcomment %}

My purpose in the video is to introduce myself and my challenges with a style of communication in an engaging way.

To present expected challenges and set goals in related to a mode of communication, I chose to share a personal anecdote about a time in class where I struggled with the written mode. By choosing to share a personal anecdote, I attempted to connect to the audience through an emotional appeal with a relatable story. After the anecdote, I set a goal to improve my pre-writing process. This direct response to the challenges I expect to face with goals to rise to the challenge shows that I am applying a strategy to address those struggles.

I wanted to present myself in an engaging way and my approach to an applied research project. Utilizing sound effects, motion graphics, and references from the video game Among Us, I present content in an engaging way while at the same time showcasing my personality and video game hobby.

## Audience

{% comment %}
    Who is the intended audience for your artifact; why is this an appropriate audience? How is your choice of audience reflected in your artifact?
{% endcomment %}

The intended audience for this video are other first-year students at Georgia Tech, and other faculty members in the English department. This is an appropriate audience because it reflects the project requirements for an approachable video that demonstrates my supported opinions on my challenges with a style of communication to an audience interested in those opinions. I embedded open subtitles instead of the standard closed subtitles on YouTube to make the video easier to review without audio, and to be more accessible to those with hearing impairments. By labeling each character with a different name and subtitle color, it is easy to see at a glance who is speaking in the video. I also included engaging sound effects, motion graphics, and references to the video game Among Us to hold my audience's attention and differentiate my video with humor.

## Defining Features

{% comment %}
    What are the defining features of the genre or media that you are using in this project? How do you make use of these features?
{% endcomment %}

In the medium of video, two defining features are motion graphics and video and audio composition. I made use of motion graphics by adding an animated background to the set to highlight the setting of a space ship, text graphics that accompany my argument in the video with a task list, and an ending animation. In terms of video and audio composition, I cut reaction shots to Sgt. Pikachu while overlaying audio from a one-take version of my argument, introducing variability in the scene while maintaining a cohesive argument.

## Ideas for Revision

{% comment %}
    If you had more time for revision, what would you change and why?
{% endcomment %}

If I had more time for revision, I would have utilized [Georgia Tech's Audio & Video Recording Studios](https://www.library.gatech.edu/spaces-technology/media-scholarship-commons/studio-reservations), as recording in my dorm room was not ideal. I was often working against construction noise in the background, and while I attempted to use noise gates and post processing effects to hide the construction audio in the background, I would have liked to start with clean, professional audio. The location of filming also distracted from my argument, as there were many background items that were not relevant to the video.

If I remade the video in the future, I would likely build a set or use a greenscreen in the background to better immerse the characters on the spaceship.

Finally, I would have done more of my own motion graphics instead of relying an online generator, as the ending scene of the impostor being thrown out into the airlock has a watermark from its original generator and the introductory "Emergency Meeting" graphic has chroma key artifacts.
