## Introduction

{% comment %}
    Write a one-paragraph introduction (150-200 words) to the artifact that articulates your intellectual process in composing this artifact. Put another way, explain where your ideas came from and the ways they evolved during the course of the project. You should also discuss ways the composing processes (examples: prewriting, outlining, drafting, peer reviewing, revising, editing) affected your intellectual process, and vice versa.

## Reflection

### Goals

{% comment %}
    What were the main intellectual goals of the assignment? Please situate these goals in terms of the course theme and in terms of the communication strategies you were to learn or practice.
{% endcomment %}

For this artifact, the main intellectual goal was to critically examine my own skills as a writer and communicator. As the course theme is Multimodal *Moby-Dick; or, the Whale* of WOVEN Communication, this class will heavily focus on the five modes of communication (Written, Oral, Visual, Electronic, and Nonverbal Communication). By laying out the challenges that I expect to face in relation to the written communication mode, I am planning my first year as a writer in the Georgia Tech community to prepare to write on a college level. I am also preparing to engage with the WOVEN paradigm through future assignments that I complete in this class by recognizing and applying my research into the different modes of communication for this project.

## Argument/Purpose

{% comment %}
    What is your argument or purpose? How did you make the argument or purpose visible and persuasive in your artifact?
{% endcomment %}

My purpose in the video is to introduce myself and my challenges with a style of communication in an engaging way.

To present expected challenges and set goals in related to a mode of communication, I chose to share a personal anecdote about a time in class where I struggled with the written mode. By choosing to share a personal anecdote, I attempted to connect to the audience through an emotional appeal with a relatable story. After the anecdote, I set a goal to improve my pre-writing process. This direct response to the challenges I expect to face with goals to rise to the challenge shows that I am applying a strategy to address those struggles.

I wanted to present myself in an engaging way and my approach to an applied research project. Utilizing sound effects, motion graphics, and references from the video game Among Us, I present content in an engaging way while at the same time showcasing my personality and video game hobby.
