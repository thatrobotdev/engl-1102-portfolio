# Artifact 1 â€“ Life Map

## Introduction

{% comment %}
    Write a one-paragraph introduction (150-200 words) to the artifact that articulates your intellectual process in composing this artifact. Put another way, explain where your ideas came from and the ways they evolved during the course of the project. You should also discuss ways the composing processes (examples: prewriting, outlining, drafting, peer reviewing, revising, editing) affected your intellectual process, and vice versa.
